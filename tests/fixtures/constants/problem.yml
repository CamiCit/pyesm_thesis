# SYMBOLIC PROBLEM

# definition of the objective function (scalar)

objective function:
    - Minimize(1) # dummy objective

# definition of the constraints (vector expressions)

constraints: 

    # aggregating total demand by flow
    - Q_agg - I_ff @ tran(Q) == 0

    # aggregating total demand by hourly flow
    - Q_agg_h - I_ff_h @ tran(Q_h) == 0

    # equality
