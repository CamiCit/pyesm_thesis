# SYMBOLIC PROBLEM

# definition of the objective function (scalar)

objective function:
    - Minimize(1) # dummy objective

# definition of the constraints (vector expressions)

constraints: 

    # total flows demand equals total supply
    - Q - u @ X - Y == 0  

    # industry-based technology assumption
    # - X - d @ Q == 0
    # - V == d @ diag(Q)
    
    # product-based technology assumption
    - Q - c @ X == 0
    - V == (c @ diag(X)).T

    # other endogenous variables
    - U == u @ diag(X)
    - R == r @ diag(X)
