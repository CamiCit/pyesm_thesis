# SYMBOLIC PROBLEM

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# definition of the objective function (scalar)
objective function:
    
    # minimize total operational and capital costs
    - Minimize(c @ X) 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# definition of the constraints (vector expressions)
constraints: 

    # demand by flows equals flows supply by technology
    - Q_agg - u @ X - Y == 0

    # aggregating total demand by flow
    - Q_agg - I_ff @ tran(Q) == 0

    # industry-based technology assumption
    - X - d @ tran(Q) == 0

    # operational costs
    - C == c @ diag(X)
    
    # constraint on the maximum technology by activity
    - X - X_max <= 0

    # non negativity of the decision variables
    - X >= 0
    - Q >= 0
