# SYMBOLIC PROBLEM

# definition of the objective function (scalar)

objective function:
    - Minimize(sum(C_inv+C_om)) # cost minimization

# definition of the constraints (vector expressions)

constraints: 

    # total flows demand equals total supply
    - Q_agg - u @ tran(X) - Y == 0

    # industry-based technology assumption
    - tran(X) - d @ tran(Q) == 0

    # aggregating total demand by flow
    - Q_agg - I_ff @ tran(Q) == 0

    # operational costs
    - C_om == X @ diag(c_om)

    # investment costs
    - C_inv == Cap_new @ diag(c_inv)

    # limits on production
    - X_max == Cap_op @ diag(lf_max)
    - X_min == Cap_op @ diag(lf_min)

    # capacity balance
    - Cap_op == T_yy @ Cap_new

    # constraint on the activity by technology
    - X <= X_max
    - X >= X_min

    # non negativity of the decision variables
    - Q >= 0
    - X >= 0
